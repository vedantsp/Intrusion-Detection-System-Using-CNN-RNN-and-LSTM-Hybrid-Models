# Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-CNN-RNN-and-LSTM-Hybrid-Models
Network assaults are the most prevalent and important issue in contemporary civilization. Network attacks can affect all networks in some way. To find these risks, intrusion detection is crucial.
We developed a deep learning-based hybrid ID framework that predicted and classified harmful cyber attacks using a convolutional recurrent neural network. In order to do this, we tested the system using publicly accessible data and worked to increase the accuracy of the intrusion detection. 
Neural networks could quickly predict the type and categorization of future data by extracting patterns and fingerprints from a raw dataset. To develop a real-time, effective network security framework, we improved the robustness of the neural network architecture.
